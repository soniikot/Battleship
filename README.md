<h2>Usage</h2>
You can clone the repo on your local machine. The game starts in main.js where all components and logic are put together.
Enter your name in the input field and click the "Start Game" button.
Drag and drop ships from the ship container onto your board to place them.
Once all ships are placed, start the game and take turns with the computer to attack each other's boards.
The game will indicate hits and misses, and declare a winner when all ships of one player are sunk.
